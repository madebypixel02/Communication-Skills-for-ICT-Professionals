## Email to Julia from Medicat

> Dear Julia,
>
> Thank you for reaching out to us. My name is Alex and I am head of
> *InfoFarma*’s’ technical department. Indeed, we *have* heard of
> *Medicat*. We are truly inspired by your work in developing countries,
> reaching millions of families in need. Your work reminds us that not
> everyone has the same access to pharmaceuticals, and that we must take
> action in whatever way possible to improve their dire situation.
>
> Moved by this call to action, our IT team at *InfoFarm* would like to
> embark on this project with you to digitize the NGO. Now that
> *Medicat* operates in several countries it is crucial that every
> country manages its own inventory to ensure that they operate
> independently of other countries.
>
> Such an inventory should be able to alert when certain pharmaceuticals
> are low in stock, so as to automatically request more depending on the
> varying demands of each country. Furthermore, the website should be
> able calculate and predict the demands of each country in order to
> ensure that no pharmaceutical is wasted.
>
> These are but a few ideas we believe could kick-off this project.
> While fixing a budget or time frame for this project requires careful
> planning and coordination, our experience with other clients tells us
> that the cost of a project of this size can take 1-2 years to reach
> production with a budget of roughly €300K, including the maintenance
> and support of the solution.
>
> If it is okay with you, we could arrange an in-person meeting
> next-week to discuss the details of this project. Once again, we at
> *InfoFarma* are thrilled to spearhead this overhaul and are eager to
> be a part of your journey.
>
> We look forward to hearing back from you. Regards,
>
> Alex
